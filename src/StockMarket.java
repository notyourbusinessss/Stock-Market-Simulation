/**
 * The StockMarket class is the core simulation engine for the stock trading environment.
 * It manages buyer threads, market price updates, available shares, and external influences such as news events.
 *
 * Key features include:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Dynamic price updates based on buy/sell pressure and market sentiment</li>
 *     <li>Major positive or negative events that impact the market through curated news headlines</li>
 *     <li>Observer pattern integration to notify stocks and buyers of state changes</li>
 *     <li>GUI synchronization with real-time updates via the {@link ArrowPanel}</li>
 *     <li>Pause/resume functionality via semaphores</li>
 *     <li>Thread-safe simulation loop with support for multiple buyers running in parallel</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * The StockMarket extends the {@link Unit} class as part of the simulation framework,
 * and is expected to override {@code performAction}, {@code submitStatistics}, and {@code run}.
